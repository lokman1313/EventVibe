**EventVibe** is a modern event management and discovery platform built with Next.js and TypeScript. It lets organizers create and publish events while giving attendees a clean interface to browse, discover, and book events. The platform includes a role-based admin panel for approving, publishing, and managing events.

## 🔑 Authentication & Roles

EventVibe uses **Better Auth** for authentication, extended with a custom `role` field (`admin` / `client`) on the user model. Roles determine which navigation items and pages a user can access:

- **Admin** — Can create events, manage/approve/publish events, and view all users
- **Client** — Can browse events and manage their own bookings

New users are assigned a default role server-side, so role escalation cannot be done from the client.

---

## 📸 Image Uploads

Banner images and profile pictures are uploaded client-side to **ImgBB**, and the resulting hosted URL is stored with the event/user record — no image files are stored on the server itself.
